/** 
To build a tree contains {1,2,3,4,5}. First we pick 1 as root, for the left sub tree, there are none; for the right sub tree, we need count how many possible trees are there constructed from {2,3,4,5}, apparently it's the same number as {1,2,3,4}. So the total number of trees under "1" picked as root is dp[0] * dp[4] = 14. (assume dp[0] =1). Similarly, root 2 has dp[1]*dp[3] = 5 trees. root 3 has dp[2]*dp[2] = 4, root 4 has dp[3]*dp[1]= 5 and root 5 has dp[0]*dp[4] = 14. Finally sum the up and it's done.
